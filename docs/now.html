<p>(This is a <a href="https://nownownow.com/about">now page</a>)</p>
<ul>
<li>Writing the inaugural blog post for this site (or tweaking its CSS)</li>
<li>Getting back into jogging. I’m taking it very slowly–about a mile every other day–as I’m the heaviest I’ve ever been right now. If a 5K is hosted in my area this year, I’ll make it my goal to compete in it.</li>
<li>Reading <em>The Active Life</em> (Palmer). I must admit, I’ve lost all the reading momentum I had at the start of the year. Not sure how to make it a habit again. <strong>Books I’ve finished so far in 2021:</strong> <em>The Trouble with Physics</em> (Smolin), <em>Mind and Cosmos</em> (Nagel).</li>
