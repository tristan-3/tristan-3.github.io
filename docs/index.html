<h1>Hello</h1>

<p>I’m Tristan. I’m just an aspiring IT professional right now. In the near future, I hope to have turned my interest in systems administration into (the start of) a career. To that end, this website is for me to practice <a href="https://www.swyx.io/learn-in-public/">learning in public</a>. I’ve also wanted a personal website for what’s been years at this point.</p>
<p>If you want to know more about me, you can see what I’m doing right <a href="/now.html">now</a>. If you want to actually talk to me, send an email addressed to my first name “at” this domain. I’m not on any social media platforms unless you count <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/in/tristan3/">LinkedIn</a>. There’s my <a href="https://github.com/tristan-3">GitHub profile</a> too.</p>
<p>And then there’s my blog posts below, of which there are none. Not yet anyways. Oh well.</p>
<p>Thanks for stopping by!</p>
