(This is a [now page](https://nownownow.com/about))

- Writing the inaugural blog post for this site (or tweaking its CSS)
- Getting back into jogging. I'm taking it very slowly--a mile every other day--as I'm the heaviest I've ever been right now. If a 5K is hosted in my area this year, I'll make it my goal to compete in it.
- Reading *The Active Life* (Palmer). I must admit, I've lost all the reading momentum I had at the start of the year. Not sure how to make it a habit again.
  - Books I've finished so far in 2021: *The Trouble with Physics* (Smolin), *Mind and Cosmos* (Nagel)
- Playing *Dragon Quest XI*.
