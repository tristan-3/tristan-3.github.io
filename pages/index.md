title: "Hello"

I'm Tristan. I'm just an aspiring IT professional right now. In the near future, I hope to have turned my interest in systems administration into (the start of) a career. To that end, this website is for me to practice [learning in public](https://www.swyx.io/learn-in-public/). And I just want to have a personal website.

If you want to know more about me, you can see what I'm doing right [now](/now.html). If you want to actually talk to me, send an email addressed to my first name "at" this domain. I'm not on any social media platforms unless you count [LinkedIn](https://www.linkedin.com/in/tristan3/). There's my [GitHub profile](https://github.com/tristan-3) too.

Then there's my blog posts below, of which there are none. Yet.

Thanks for stopping by!
